## IDEA

The idea is very simple and clear â€“ to save time.

To avoid writing all scopes manually, there is a ScopeProvider. The purpose of the ScopeProvider 
is to save time when writing code, adhere to the DRY and KIS principles, and help developers make 
the application logic more clear and straightforward. Instead of manually creating Scope, BLoC, and 
Controller for each scope, we only need to write the BLoC and Controller for the scope.

## Features

The scope_provider package provides a structured way to manage state and business logic in Flutter
applications using the Bloc pattern. It introduces new types of instances and enforces certain
rules to ensure consistency and reliability.

New Types of Instances
- ScopeController: An abstract class that serves as a controller for a Bloc. It provides a way to
  create or retrieve a Bloc instance and offers methods to interact with the Bloc and perform actions
  based on the state.
- ScopeProvider: An abstract class that acts as a base for any StatefulWidget that wants to provide
  a ScopeController, Bloc, and listen to state changes. It ensures that the widget is tightly coupled
  with the specific Bloc and controller it is managing.
- BlocEvent: An abstract class that all events of a Bloc must extend. Events in the Bloc pattern
  represent actions that trigger state changes.
- BlocState: An abstract class that all states of a Bloc must extend. It uses the Equatable package
  to ensure states can be compared by value rather than by reference.

## Rules
**State and Event Classes**: Each state and event of a Bloc should extend BlocState and BlocEvent
respectively!!!.
This ensures that states can be compared by value rather than by reference, which is useful in the
Bloc pattern.

Generic Parameters: ScopeProvider requires four type parameters to function correctly:
- SF: The type of the StatefulWidget that the ScopeProvider is extending.
- BS: The type of BlocState (the state managed by the Bloc).
- BL: The type of Bloc that handles BlocEvent and emits BlocState.
- SC: The type of ScopeController that creates or manages the Bloc.

## Description for scope_provider.dart
The scope_provider.dart file defines the core components of the scope_provider package:
- BlocState: An abstract class that all states of a Bloc must extend. It uses the Equatable package
  to ensure states can be compared by value rather than by reference.
- BlocEvent: An abstract class that all events of a Bloc must extend. Events in the Bloc pattern
  represent actions that trigger state changes.
- ScopeController: An abstract class that serves as a controller for a Bloc. It provides a way to
  create or retrieve a Bloc instance and offers methods to interact with the Bloc and perform actions
  based on the state.
- _ScopeBuilder: A StatelessWidget that is responsible for building the Bloc and using it with the
  provided ScopeController. It's an internal helper widget.
- ScopeProvider: An abstract class that acts as a base for any StatefulWidget that wants to provide
  a ScopeController, Bloc, and listen to state changes. It ensures that the widget is tightly coupled
  with the specific Bloc and controller it is managing.
- _ScopeInherited: A custom InheritedWidget that holds the ScopeController and the current
  BlocState. This widget allows its descendants to access the controller and the current state, and
  it decides whether to notify listeners when the state changes.


## Usage

To use the scope_provider as package, follow these steps:
```yaml
dependencies:
  scope_provider:
    path: ../scope_provider
```

or add code manually from the SCOPE_PROVIDER_BASE.md file.

Create a BLoc for your scope:
There is no such rules for creating a BLoc. You can create it as you want. But it is nessesary to 
extend BlocEvent and BlocState classes for your Event and State bloc.

```dart

sealed class MessageEvent extends BlocEvent {
  MessageEvent();
  // Your events here
}

sealed class MessageState extends BlocState {
  MessageState();
  // Your states here
}

class MessageBloc extends Bloc<MessageEvent, MessageState> {
  MessageBloc() : super(const MessageState());
  // Your logic here
}
```

And now we can create controller for our Scope:

```dart
class MessageController extends ScopeController<MessageBloc> {
  @override
  /// ensure that event and state are extended from BlocEvent and BlocState
  MessageBloc get createBloc => MessageBloc();

  bool isCanShowMessage(BuildContext context) {
    /// A getBloc returns the bloc instance of MessageBloc because it is extended 
    /// from ScopeController that has a type of MessageBloc
    final bloc = getBloc(context);
    // Your logic here
  }

  String getMessage(BuildContext context) {
    final bloc = getBloc(context);
    // Your logic here
  }
}
```

Extend ScopeProvider in your StatefulWidget instead of basic State:
```dart
class MessageScope extends StatefulWidget {
  const MessageScope({super.key});
  
  final Widget child;
  
  @override
  State<MessageBuilder> createState() => _MessageScopeState();
}

class _MessageScopeState extends ScopeProvider<MessageBuilder, MessageState,
    MessageBloc, MessageController> {
  @override
  MessageController createController() {
    return MessageController();
  }

  @override
  Widget onBuild(BuildContext context) {
    return widget.child;
  }

  @override
  void onListen(
      BuildContext context,
      MessageState state,
      MessageController controller,
      ) {
    // for listener your can add any logic that you want to be listened
    final isCanShowMessage = controller.isCanShowMessage(context);
    if (isCanShowMessage) {
      DefaultSnackBar.show(
        context: context,
        message: controller.getMessage(context),
      );
    }
  }
}
```
Use the scope controller in your widget:

````dart
final messageController = ScopeProvider.of<MessageController>(context);
final message = messageController.getMessage(context);
````

## Additional information

ScopeProvider is a generic class that requires four type parameters to function correctly:
- MessageScope: This is the type of the StatefulWidget that the ScopeProvider is extending.
  It ensures that the ScopeProvider is tightly coupled with the specific widget it is managing.
- MessageState: This represents the state managed by the Bloc. It is used to define the type of
  state that the Bloc will emit and the ScopeProvider will listen to.
- MessageBloc: This is the Bloc that handles events and emits states. It encapsulates the business
  logic and state management for the ScopeProvider.
- MessageController: This is the ScopeController that creates or manages the Bloc. It provides
  methods to interact with the Bloc and perform actions based on the state.

By specifying these types, ScopeProvider can correctly instantiate and manage the Bloc, listen to
state changes, and provide the necessary context and controller to the widget tree.
